# Using the DCC Search

 - To get a search URL that can be scraped, you must perform a search manually, then navigate to the second page and back to the first page. Insert this URL into the `src/searchResults/scrape.js` page with the `startIndex` URL parameter passed in from the function.
 - The format of the Date Registered From field is `d/m/y`. For example: "1/1/2019". (??? not sure about this). Sometimes when I put a date in and then go back, it is changed to something like "01-jan-2019".
 - Inchicore is in the "South Central" area.
